This program is the implementation of Fast Minimum Spanning Tree using Kmeans in the research paper [FMST.pdf](https://github.com/Hunaid2000/FMST-Kmeans/files/6986247/FMST.pdf). The proposed algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer scheme to produce an approximate MST with theoretical time complexity of O(N<sup>1.5</sup>), which is faster than the conventional MST algorithms with O(N<sup>2</sup>). It consists of two stages Divide & Conquer Stage and the Refinement Stage.
The Kmeans uses &#8730;N clusters in Divide & Conquer Stage and &#8730;N-1 clusters in Refinement Stage.
